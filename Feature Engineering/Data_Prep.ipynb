I was also learning the guitar during 4th grade through 5th. Everyone has a talent or skill. I learned everything I had to know in 6th grade ,so I was ready to play the violin in 7th grade. Although my music skills are still improving, I would still consider it a talent or skill.\\n\\nI've learned to play different instruments such as: the guitar, percussion, xylophone, and the violin, which is what i'm currently playing. She really enjoyed it. At first I joined chorus in 1st grade and finished in 5th grade. I like participating in music contests, concerts, etc. In band, I learned how to play the recorder. I really felt passionate about the violin so I kept playing ,and still am ,and yet will continue until high school.\\n\\nMy music skills can be useful at times, for example: my parents once asked me to play a song for their wedding, they thought it was marvelous. After learning the recorder I switch instruments to a xylophone, that played during 4th grade.\\n\\nSince I didnt really like playing the xylophone, I chose to do percussion for 5th grade. In my case, Its music. This year I went to New York for a violin concert, it was amazing.\\n\\nMy music skills have yet to improve, but until then I will continue trying new ways of music.. I played it from 2nd grade to 3rd grade. I really enjoyed it ,so I chose to learn an instrument, which ended with me joining band. when I entered middle school I decided to turn things around by choosing to do orchestra\",\n          \"Interesting people are often sought after for new ideas and creative approaches to life. We\\u2019re more likely to stay energized and motivated when we have a positive attitude because we\\u2019re beaming confidence rather than negativity and apathy. Being responsible, amusing, and interesting are all positive qualities that go hand-in-hand with having a positive attitude. . For instance, having a positive attitude toward a job interview may result in a job offer with our dream employer. Positive attitudes can help us gain friends, be more productive, and enjoy life more fully. When we take responsibly for our actions and our attitudes, we show that we are contributing members of society, and people respect us for it. This attitude can help us get through the inevitable disappointments life offers to all of us. \\n\\nA positive attitude makes us approach life with hope and a sense of determination. It also helps others perceive us in a more positive way since attitudes are contagious.\\n\\nHaving a positive attitude can have an enormous impact on the way we experience our lives, and our success. Being amusing and entertaining can lift others\\u2019 spirits, as well as our own, and helps us make and keep connections with others. \\nHaving a positive attitude is essential to success in life. On the other hand, an applicant who enters the room with a negative attitude may unintentionally offend the interviewer or leave a negative impression\",\n          \"When drafting an outline, take note of the key arguments of why using a writing checklist is beneficial. This checklist typically includes elements such as identifying the audience, developing a thesis statement, and planning out the structure of the essay or writing piece. It\\u2019s essential to be familiar with this checklist and understand why it\\u2019s so important to utilize it in the writing process. Consider using anecdotes or other examples to illustrate why one opinion may be more useful than the other. This summary section is the perfect place to link back to the initial points made about the checklist, and suggest that, ultimately, it can be extremely helpful in the writing process for those who utilize it.. \\n\\nAnd while the consensus may be that a writing checklist is beneficial, it's still important to explore different opinions and perspectives. To begin, it\\u2019s helpful to research what a writing checklist entails. \\n\\nFinally, draft a conclusion highlighting the importance of utilizing a writing checklist. Consider adding supporting details of how the checklist helps the writer with organization, and developing a clear purpose and direction for the piece. Research whether some writers would find a checklist to be too restrictive or even unhelpful in the writing process.\\n\\nIn the body of the essay, discuss both sides and present evidence to support each view of writing with and without a checklist. This can ultimately lead to a resolution or compromise on the use of a checklist in the writing process. \\nAs any writer knows, it\\u2019s important to have a checklist when preparing to write\"\n

Trying to make the positive influence in your life with out positive attitude is impossible. When we take a look at the most famous entrepreneurs we see how a great environment they have, and how successful the people around them is, like they are. I believe the majority will agree with this statement, but everyone does not agree, and talk about positive attitude. All of the hard work has no meaning if there is no pay back for this hard work. Famous entrepreneurs like Elon Musk would not be the Elon Musk that we know today if he did not had the positive attitude. Even in our daily life, when we start of our they in a negative way; the rest of the day follows that bad influence, and makes us miss the good parts of the day.\\n\\nHaving a negative environment affects the individuals the worst way possible, especially if the individual does not have a positive attitude to fight back. There has to be a effort to find the right way, but having the negativity is going to close the door for opportunities. Fighting back with a positive attitude is also going to influence others to have a better view, so it does not just affect the individuals success, but others too. The positive influence follows it self and creates a better habitat, and a better habitat will cause success.\\n\\nReaching to the best of the goal is impossible with out hard work. When individuals miss the first chance they think there is no more chance and they loose the rest of there positivity. If the goal is success, then missing the chance to making it come true must be avoided. Elon Musk created a company named \\\"SpaceX\\\" for Space craft, and if he gave up on the first failure, and did not had the positive attitude, he would have never reached to his goal, and be successful. He created his own chance to success with positive attitude.\\n\\nIn conclusion, positive attitude has a big influence on success. Positive attitude is what is going to bring the opportunities, and make the individuals create their own chances. Loosing the sight while working hard causes to miss the train, but having positive attitude makes individuals seek for opportunities. It is the positive attitude that spreads the influence and makes a better habitat. No matter what the goal is, in order to approach that goal, and to be successful you need hard work. The term success has a different meaning for everyone, but still it is what everyone wants. People miss the importance of positive attitude which is the key for success.\\n\\nChances in life comes and goes that some might not even see. Positive attitude is the key to success.. However, setting up a positive mind set is the part what individuals misses\",\n          \"It is very scary and make me sad at the same time. I have many experiences keep seeing people about failure. I though that learning another language was a new obstacle for me to keep going we my life.\\n\\nAlso, success consists of going from failure because people get experiences to teach people. Had you ever try to help others? I have it done many times. In many occasion I help the person to be better like getting solutions with the problems and it is very difficul to teach others with the problems and try to make them better.\\n\\nSeeing our life in a failure can be the worst thing, but keeping trying to do better things each day is going to be the better effort in our life and that is going to help us to get more enthusiastic every day. In my position I have a experience; when I was in my country I did not what to do with my life; I just was trying to finish my middle school, get a job and then have a family and now here I am making better things for my life; now I am tinking about to have a better life. I am strongly agree the failures in our lifes means to keep going and be a successful person. One reason people always fell many times keeping doing the same mistakes in several times in their lifes. If we use social medias we can see people talking about their lifes or using drugs and drugs makes the person to lose more their mind.\\n\\nHowever, success consists of going from failure because failure help us to learn more in our lifes. Did you know is that 90% 0f the teenagers kill them self instated of find help to keep going with their lifes. Learning from failure to failure is better for all the people. It is very helpful to find ways to be better in the world because every person had to have new things to do the life better for themselves and help others if they are struggling with their life.                      . People that are better to them can make bullying at them because they feel that they are perfect than others .Many of the people that keep thinking that they are a loser think about diying is the better thing to get out of the failures. There are many people that think that they are failure and they are not; I think that every people are genius. But doing the same mistakes many times does not help people to be successful; makes the person wake in front of others. We are capable of doing many things it does not matter how many times we have to do the same things to be better in our feature but we have to keep going not matter what. Having the enthusiasm in our mind can be the better word to start our life every day. Although some say success not consists of going from failure because people always fell many times keeping doing the same mistakes in several times in their lifes, actually success consists of going from failure because failure help us to learn more in our lifes and get experiences to teach other people.\\n\\nThose who believe success not consists of going from failure have they reasons. When I was in my country I saw this person trying to be better but at the same time this person was with many problems that did not let to keep going. when I came to USA I was tinking about how am I going to do if I do not nothing about the language but now I feel more conformist knowing the language because makes me keep going studying. The things is that people don not let the talents get out and that can be because they think about others people opinions about them\",\n          \"It gives us the ability to take a step back and evaluate our choices without being limited by knowledge.. It can help us visualize our end goals and the journey to get there before we take our first steps. Finally, imagination can help us cope with the pressures of college life. \\n\\nFurthermore, imagination can help us in college. \\nImagination brings an invaluable perspective to the decision-making process. A thoughtful blend of imagination and knowledge can help us make the best choices for our lives, often without resorting to the stress that knowledge alone can create.\\n\\nImagination offers an alternative view of the world around us and allows us to see the potentials available to us, even before we make a decision. When it comes to making life decisions, imagination can offer us a brilliant new angle: Escapism, exploration and creativity. Additionally, imagination grants us access to ideas and perspectives that knowledge alone may not. It gives us an avenue for problem solving and helps us to think outside the box. In many ways, imagination can spark our minds to discover solutions never before considered\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"huggingface\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
